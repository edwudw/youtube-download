This program allows users to download youtube videos in both video and audio form. It makes use of the youtube-dl command line tool, and is essentially a bad GUI version of it.

* Version: 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

Download the program, extract the zip file, and run "youtube (run this).exe"
Note that after you press Download, the program will NOT RESPOND. You can look at the debug window to see the program's progress.
